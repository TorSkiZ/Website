      During my technical school years, I designed and managed the official
      <HyperLink href="https://zstpleszew.edupage.org/">website</HyperLink>
      for the institution. Currently, I oversee the maintenance and updates of the
      <HyperLink href="https://euro-dach.com/">website</HyperLink>
      for Euro-Dach Smętek. One of my notable projects includes developing a
      <HyperLink href="https://github.com/TorSkiZ/Calculator">Python calculator</HyperLink>
      capable of plotting linear functions. Additionally, I built this
      <HyperLink href="https://github.com/TorSkiZ/Website">website</HyperLink>
