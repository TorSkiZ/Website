    <BodyParagraph>
      My name is Wiktor Wasiński, and I am 20 years old. I live in a small village with a population
      of about 130 residents. I have a deep passion for computer science, technology, and
      electronics. I currently work as a Frontend Developer at
      <HyperLink href="https://mirit.pl/">Mirit Software House</HyperLink>
      , where I am also learning DevOps. I enjoy listening to Polish rock and symphonic music, and
      when it comes to food, I’m open to almost everything edible.

    <BodyParagraph>
      In my free time, I love playing story-driven computer games, watching movies, exploring new
      musical genres, learning new skills, and spending time with friends. I also have a passion for
      travel—whether by car or occasionally by bicycle. In addition, I manage my own Proxmox server,
      which allows me to run a personal mail server, DNS, and even host game servers for the
      projects I collaborate on with friends.
    </BodyParagraph>
    <BodyParagraph>
      I am always eager to expand my knowledge and embrace new challenges in the ever-evolving field
      of technology. My goal is to create innovative solutions that make a difference, and I believe
      in the power of continuous learning and collaboration. If you’d like to get to know me better
      or discuss potential collaborations, please feel free to get in touch.
