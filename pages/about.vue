      Hi! My name is Wiktor Wasiński and I am 20 years old. I live in a village with a population of
      over 100 people. I am interested in computer science, technology, electronics, and automotive.
      I listen to Polish rock and symphonic music. When it comes to food, I love practically
      everything that’s edible. Currently, I am interning at a Software House as a programmer. In my
      free time, I enjoy playing computer games, watching movies, listening to music, learning, and
      meeting with friends. Occasionally, I even like to go to a disco. I love traveling by car and
      sometimes by bicycle. I manage my own Proxmox server, which allows me to run my own mail
      server, DNS, and game hosting for the games my friends and I want to play. If you would like
      to get to know me better, feel free to contact me here.
