My name is Wiktor Wasiński and I am 20 years old. I live in a village with a population of over 100 people. I am interested in computer science, technology, electronics, and automotive. I listen to Polish rock and symphonic music. When it comes to food, I love practically everything that’s edible. Currently, I am interning at a Software House as a programmer. In my free time, I enjoy playing computer games, watching movies, listening to music, learning, and meeting with friends. Occasionally, I even like to go to a disco. I love traveling by car and sometimes by bicycle. I manage my own Proxmox server, which allows me to run my own mail server, DNS, and game hosting for the games my friends and I want to play. If you would like to get to know me better, feel free to contact me here. ")])),_:1})]),_:1})}}});export{I as default};
